'An HTTP header is metadata that is sent along with an HTTP request or response'
'E.g. A request may come with a header designating that the response be in English'
'A response may come with the date and time the server thinks it is'

'My system either already knows the IP associated with the URL or otherwise has to ask the DNS what IP is associated with the URL'
'My system then requests that the server at that IP send the information from the webpage at that URL'
'Finally my system receives that info from the server, my browser interprets the info, and then shows it to me'
